            <p class="section__p italics space textcenter">Greetings to all users, Napat Worrasangasilp here! I created LinkHarbor in 2024 as a part of my Senior Project at Satit Kaset IP. </p>
            <p class="section__p italics space textcenter">Having experienced the tedious process of collecting sources and writing research bibliographies firsthand, I came up with an idea to create a Google Chrome Extension designed to streamline users' research workflows. After months of coding, I'm proud to say LinkHarbor became a reality. I hope this extension will help you all, even if just a little! </p>
